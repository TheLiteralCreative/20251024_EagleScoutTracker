## 3) Acceptance & Policy Notes (for implementers)

## 4) Data Model Suggestions (UX)
- **Requirement fields:** `id`, `title`, `detail`, `status`, `date_completed`, `signed_by`, `evidence_link`, `source_url`, `subtasks[]`, `notes`.  
- **Hike/bike schema:** distance, route GPX, approvals, hazards discussed (checklist).  
- **Aquatics schema:** location, lifeguard present (y/n), Safe Swim Defense checklist, test results.  
- **First aid schema:** scenarios demonstrated (checkboxes), kit review date, prevention plan text.  
- **BOR workflow:** gate “Ready for BOR” when **2C‑1 through 2C‑10** complete and **2C‑11** recorded.

---

## 5) Uncertainty Box
- **Unknowns:** Mid‑year edits to online rank wording; local council policies for aquatics alternatives.  
- **Assumptions:** The **2022 Second Class PDF** remains text‑equivalent to the current online requirements; **Scouts BSA Requirements 2025** is consistent.  
- **Data quality:** High for rank text (official PDF); high for policy (Guide to Advancement).  
- **Reduce uncertainty:** Link to the **official PDF** and the **Requirements 2025** book; include an admin‑visible **“last verified”** timestamp.  
- **Confidence:** **High** (checked **2025‑10‑24**).
