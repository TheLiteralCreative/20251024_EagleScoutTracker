## 3) Acceptance & Policy Notes (for implementers)
- **Testing/Sign‑off authority:** Unit leader designates who may test/sign; record name & date with each requirement.  
- **Cooking execution:** Model 2e as three sub‑tasks (breakfast, lunch, dinner) within a single campout event; require gear and food‑safety tasks (2c–2d) to be completed **before** allowing 2e sign‑off.  
- **Aquatics alternatives:** Show the **council‑approved alternative** pathway for **6a/6e** only when a jurisdictional flag is toggled; store proof of council authorization.  
- **Service tracking:** Allow multiple entries to sum to **three hours** with project approval metadata.  
- **Emergency plan artifact:** Provide a simple template upload for **7e** (PDF/image) plus a text summary field.  
- **Recruitment (10):** Capture invitee name (optional), event, and method (verbal/text/social); allow privacy‑friendly redaction in exports.  
- **BOR workflow:** Gate “Ready for BOR” when **FC‑1 through FC‑11** complete and **FC‑12** recorded.

## 4) Data Model Suggestions (UX)
- **Requirement fields:** `id`, `title`, `detail`, `status`, `date_completed`, `signed_by`, `evidence_link`, `source_url`, `subtasks[]`, `notes`.  
- **Cooking schema:** menu (items, nutrition notes), budget, quantities list, gear checklist, food‑safety checklist, campout link, meals prepared (B/L/D), assistants, cleanup verified.  
- **Navigation schema:** course distance, height/width measurement method, GPS route GPX, arrival verification.  
- **Aquatics schema:** swimmer test results, trip‑afloat checklist, craft type, line‑rescue drill log.  
- **First aid schema:** bandages demonstrated, transports, CPR steps explained, utilities hazards, emergency plan file, potable‑water methods.  
- **Service schema:** hours, project(s), approval, reflection linking to Scout Law point(s).

## 5) Uncertainty Box
- **Unknowns:** Mid‑year edits to wording; rare council‑approved aquatics alternatives procedures and documentation.  
- **Assumptions:** The **2022 First Class PDF** matches the current online requirements and the **Scouts BSA Requirements 2025** book.  
- **Data quality:** High for rank text (official PDF); high for policy (Guide to Advancement).  
- **Reduce uncertainty:** Link live to the **First Class PDF** and the **Requirements 2025** book; show an admin‑visible **“last verified”** timestamp (this doc: **2025‑10‑24**).  
- **Confidence:** **High** (checked **2025‑10‑24**).
