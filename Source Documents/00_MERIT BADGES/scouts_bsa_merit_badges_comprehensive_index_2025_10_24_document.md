## 4) Complete A–Z List (live, official)
For the **comprehensive list of all current merit badges** (including newly added or renamed badges and any mid‑year requirement changes), use the official **A–Z index**:  
**scouting.org/skills/merit‑badges/all/**  
Each badge page hosts: (a) overview/description, (b) **current requirements** (fed dynamically), and (c) a **free pamphlet PDF** link.

> If you want, I can expand this document with **one‑line descriptions** for *every* A–Z badge and export a master spreadsheet for unit distribution.

---

## 5) Uncertainty Box
- **Unknowns:** Mid‑year edits can occur on the badge pages (dynamic feed from Scoutbook). Exact text may change after this check date.
- **Assumptions:** Official badge pages are the **source of truth** when they conflict with printed pamphlets or annual books.
- **Data quality:** High; all links are official. News link on pamphlet access is informational and matches current Hub behavior.
- **Reduce uncertainty:** Re‑verify the Eagle‑required list and any requirement text against the **Eagle‑Required** page and specific badge pages before BORs.
- **Confidence:** High (checked against official sources on 2025‑10‑24).
